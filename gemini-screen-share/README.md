# multimodal-live-api-web-console (Enhanced)

This is built on top of [google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console/tree/main). Credit to Google Gemini team for building the original `multimodal-live-api-web-console` - a sample app that demonstrates Google Gemini capabilities.

* I enhanced Google Gemini's sample project by adding a tool call support so that you can take a screenshot by simply saying "_take a screenshot_."
* [Sample video](https://x.com/sam_twite/status/1880494096659411171)
